## 📖 Usage

### Adding a Problem
1. Fill in the problem details:
   - **Problem Name** - The name of the coding problem
   - **Pattern** - Algorithm pattern (e.g., Two Pointers, Sliding Window)
   - **Topic** - Category (Arrays, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
   - **Difficulty** - Easy, Medium, or Hard
   - **Link** - Optional URL to the problem
   - **Time Taken** - How long you spent solving it
   - **Notes** - Key insights, approach, mistakes

2. Set your confidence level (1-5 stars)
3. Check "Solved without hints" if applicable
4. Mark "Need revision" for challenging problems

### Understanding Spaced Repetition
The system uses scientifically-proven intervals:
- **Day 1** - Initial solve
- **Day 3** - First review
- **Day 7** - Second review
- **Day 14** - Third review
- **Day 30** - Fourth review

Higher confidence levels extend intervals, lower confidence shortens them.

### Tracking Progress
- **Dashboard Stats** - Total problems, solved count, due for review
- **Daily Streak** - Maintain consistency by solving problems daily
- **Analytics Charts** - Visualize your progress over time
- **Topic Performance** - See which topics need more practice
- **Weak Areas** - Automatically identified patterns to focus on

### Data Management
- **Export** - Click "Export" button to download JSON backup
- **Import** - Use "Import" button to restore from backup
- **Multiple Profiles** - Login with different usernames for separate tracking
